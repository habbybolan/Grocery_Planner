# Grocery Planner

## So far ##
An in the works, grocery/offlineRecipe planner app, programmed in Java for Android. <br>
Makes use of MVP UI architecture with a Room database and dagger library for dependency injection. <br>

## In the future ##
I have plans to connect the app to an online service with a RESTful api to access a msSql database, as well as further functionality to make a great app.
